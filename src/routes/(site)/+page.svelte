	<h2>Hello and welcome to Svelper!</h2>
	<p>
		If you're a <a href="https://svelte.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Svelte</a> developer
		or a web developer in general, you might be interested in checking out Svelper, which is my personal
		playground and collection of resources for all things Svelte. I've built it as a place for me to
		experiment with Svelte and try out new things, and I'd love to share it with others who are also
		interested in this exciting JavaScript framework or web development in general.
	</p>
	<p>
		Svelper is a collection of fun stuff that I've put together over time, including links to some
		of the most useful libraries, a collection of code references to help you get started with
		Svelte development, and some handy copy/paste utils that can speed up your workflow. I've also
		included information about GitHub Actions and other tools that I've found helpful in my own
		development process.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've found that building Svelper has helped me to explore the framework as well as other web
		APIs more deeply and learn new things along the way. Whether you're a seasoned Svelte developer
		or just getting started, I hope that Svelper can be a helpful resource for you as well. On a
		more personal note I have kept a log of most of the things I've learned while building Svelper
		and saved it in <a
			href="https://github.com/shadovo/svelper/blob/main/THINGS_LEARNED.md"
			rel="noopener noreferrer"
			target="_blank">THINGS_LEARNED.md</a
		> in the project.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you need a break from coding, why not try playing one of my <a href="/games">games</a> I've included
		in Svelper. These games are a great way to take your mind off coding for a little while and have
		some fun. However, I've also found that games can be a great way to practice your coding skills so
		the source code for each game is also linked to and available on GitHub.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to the games, I've also included some <a href="/tools">tools</a> like a breathing timer
		that shows you a timer for relaxing and mindful breathing. This tool can be a helpful way to reduce
		stress and stay focused during long coding sessions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Of course, Svelper is always a work in progress, and I'm constantly adding new resources and
		features to make it even better. So if you have any suggestions or feedback, I'm always happy to
		hear it!
	</p>
	<p>
		So if you're interested in checking it out, feel free to take a look and let me know what you
		think. And if you have any suggestions for how I can improve it, <a
