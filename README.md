This is the source for [www.svelper.com](http://www.svelper.com) which is a for free, for fun project. I build this to learn more about Svelte and SvelteKit as well as have a collection of things I find useful when developing but always have to look up everytime I create a new project ðŸ˜….

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
